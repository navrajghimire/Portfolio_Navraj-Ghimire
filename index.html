        <h2>Professional Experience .......................................................................................................................</h2>
        <p>As a <strong>Senior Team leader</strong> in Print Production Management, my major responsibility was to linearize, characterize and optimize the ICC workflow. Create workflow on the Gmg Colour proof as per the required proof standard for both local (Mumbai, India) as well as the remote proofer based at Toronto, Canada. I visited leading printers (Litho and Gravure) across India, attending the online shade approvals. The Major brands for whom I attended the approvals were Heinz India, Zydus Wellness, Tetley (TGBL), Amazon India and Britannia etc. The leading printers I worked for shade approvals were Huhtamaki PPL, TCPL, Parksons Packaging Ltd. ITC Ltd. <br>
          Over the past 15 years, I have specialized in ensuring a Colour-managed workflow within the organisation. I was responsible to ensure all the proofs are validated as per the Fogra 39L standard for the Indian Printers and Gracol 2013 and other custom profiles for Canadian and American Printers. I have an experience of recent 3 years, working for a Canadian agency, Invok brands (www.invokbrands.com), as a part of my last assignment. This role involved managing a team of 16 to help team Invok with their prepress requirement, as per the supplied printer specifications. Furthermore, based on my performance I was elevated to the position of Senior Team Lead. I was also involved in planning and delivery management in the initial days at my last assignment. Before leaving the last organisation, I was actively involved in development and training of 2 resources for Colour management.<br>
          Additionally, as a <strong>Technical Support Engineer </strong>role at an earlier assignment, I got an opportunity to attend and perform the X-rite exact’s annual calibration process, setup and install new Epson printer with Spectro proofer out of the box. I also have an experience of fingerprinting of gravure printers and standardisation of the offset press.<br>
          As a <strong>Project Manager</strong> for a Security Print firm, I had an opportunity to involve in discussion with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), for the setup of the RUPAY payment card printing in India. Understand the PCI-DSS compliance requirements and manage the ISO 27001 certification, required for the Information security of the financial data being embedded in the chip of the card.<br>
          Apart from this as an <strong>Assistant Colour Manager </strong>which was my major assignment till date, I was responsible for Colour managed output and daily validation of various substrates on each printer and proofer at multiple locations across India. I am also proficient in calibration of Macintosh and Windows display monitors, HP Printers, Epson Proofers , Camera and Scanner to ensure correct colour output. Colour management of lesser-known rips, not supporting profiling. Shade matching on different substrates. Explore new ink and cost saving software’s. New Colour management software and Hardware R&D.
