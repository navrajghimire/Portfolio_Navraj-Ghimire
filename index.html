        <section id="ProfessionalExperience">
         <h2>Professional Experience </h2>
          <p>As a <strong>Senior Team leader</strong> in Print Production Management, my major responsibility was to linearize, characterize and optimize the ICC workflow. Create workflow on the Gmg Colour proof as per the required proof standard for both local (Mumbai, India) as well as the remote proofer based at Toronto, Canada. I visited leading printers (Litho and Gravure) across India, attending the online shade approvals. <br>
             Over the past 15 years, I have specialized in ensuring a Colour-managed workflow within the organisation. I was responsible to ensure all the proofs are validated as per the Fogra 39L standard for the Indian Printers and Gracol 2013 and other custom profiles for Canadian and American Printers.<br>
             <br>
             Additionally, as a <strong>Technical Support Engineer </strong>role at an earlier assignment, I got an opportunity to attend and perform the X-rite exact’s annual calibration process, setup and install new Epson printer with Spectro proofer out of the box. <br>
             <br>
             As a <strong>Project Manager</strong> for a Security Print firm, I had an opportunity to involve in discussion with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), for the setup of the RUPAY payment card printing in India.<br>
           <br>
             Apart from this as an <strong>Assistant Colour Manager </strong>which was my major assignment till date, I was responsible for Colour managed output and daily validation of various substrates on each printer and proofer at multiple locations across India.
